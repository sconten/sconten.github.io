Well, it looks like this is the inaugural post on my newly minted GitHub Pages blog. Stay tuned for updates! I'm primailry going to be using the blog as a way to share updates from my geophysics / rock physics library, rppy, so if that's your thing, hopefully there will be something here to interest you. I'll occasionally be using the site as a launchpad to explore other areas of interest to me, ranging from more geologically focused areas, explorations into the scary world of physical sedimentology, sequence stratigraphy, etc, over to travelogue style posts showing assorted gological trips, all the way to the computing side of things. Machine learning, statistical analysis, data management, and other more computing-focused areas. 

Anyhow, stay tuned (or not).
