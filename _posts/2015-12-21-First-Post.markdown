Son et lumiere - a French term, meaning "sound and light", that refers to outdoor entertainment shows at historical sights, where lighting effects are projected onto the building, and accompanied by narration and music. A son et lumiere show is designed to present the historical context and significance of the site to a wide audience, in an entertaining, easy to understand way.

I chose the term for the name of the blog, to represent several concepts. First, "sound". Geophysics in the oil and gas exploration industry (my day job, and where my interests mostly lie), utilizes seismic data to a degree tht far outstrips the rest of the geophysical "universe", potential field methods being one example. This is the "sound" component - the seismic source used to create the incident wavefield in the subsurface, the wavefield that is necessary for the seismic experiment.

Second, "lumiere". Light, meant to convey the idea of openness, and trasparency. A committment to open source principles in both the raw data and analysis methods used, as much as possible. Geophysics as a scientific field requires collaboration and communication in order to advance, and that collaboration cannot be done without clear and unambiguous sharing of data and methods.

Finally, the phrase as a whole, "son et lumiere" - the easy to digest, approachable, fun and entertaining explanation of the background, context, and approach used to attack a problem. What are the physical principles in use, what is the provenance of the data used, what is the approach taken to solve the problem, and what assumptions and uncertainties are inherent once all of the above are considered.

So welcome, it's great to have you here. Please leave a comment if you like the blog, or have something to say. Let's start the conversation.
